    "title": "The Story Behind Moment",
    "paragraph1": "Moment was born out of a deep and simple human need — to preserve the memory of those who will forever remain in our hearts. We believe that no important story should be forgotten. Every life is a unique journey filled with events, emotions, victories, and meaning. These moments deserve to live on — in the memory of loved ones, in the stories of friends, and in the hearts of future generations.",
    "paragraph2": "We created Moment as a social and human-centered project where anyone can share a story about a loved one. It's a place where memory becomes accessible, alive, and warm. Our goal is not just to help people remember, but to encourage them to share their memories — because true remembrance is what we pass on to others.",
    "paragraph3": "Over time, old photos fade, get lost, or simply disappear. We often face the sad truth that the family pictures we once saw as children are gone years later, leaving behind only fragments of memories that can no longer be restored.",
    "paragraph4": "Today, the problem of memory loss hasn’t disappeared — it has simply taken a digital form. Photos, videos, voice recordings, meaningful letters, and memories are scattered across countless devices and platforms: phones, USB drives, disks, cloud storages, and chats. We don’t always manage to save them, and one day we risk losing something truly precious. Moment helps bring everything together in one place, so memories aren’t lost, erased, or forgotten.",
    "paragraph5": "We all have stories we’re proud of. We believe these stories shouldn’t stay locked away in personal archives — they deserve to be shared.",
    "paragraph6": "With Moment, you can preserve and pass on what truly matters. It might be one word, one photo, one story — but that single piece can become the link between generations."
